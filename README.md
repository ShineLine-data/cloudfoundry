# Deployment with Cloud Foundry: Blue-Green Strategy

## What is Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry is an open-source, **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** cloud computing platform. Its primary purpose is to make it faster and easier for developers to build, test, deploy, and scale applications.

It provides a high level of abstraction by sitting on top of infrastructure (like AWS, Azure, GCP, or private vSphere clusters) and handles all the underlying complexities of managing servers, networks, and operating systems.

The mantra of Cloud Foundry is: "**Itâ€™s all about the app.**" This mantra is achievable thanks to the **cf push** magic. The workflow is as follow :
1. Write Code: A developer writes an application (e.g., in Java, Node.js, Python, Go, .NET Core, etc.).
2. Login: The developer logs into the Cloud Foundry platform via the command line interface (CLI) using cf login.
3. Push: The developer pushes the code to the platform using the command:
   ```
   cf push MY-APP-NAME
   ```

## Key Components and Architecture

A Cloud Foundry platform is composed of several components that work together:
* The **CLI**: The command-line tool developers use to interact with the platform.
* **Buildpacks**: Provide the framework and runtime support for your applications. They handle the compilation of your code.
* **Diego**: The brain and scheduler. It manages the application containers, decides where to run them, and keeps them alive.
* **Gorouter**: The traffic cop. It routes incoming web requests to the appropriate application instances.
* **Service Brokers**: Manage "managed services" like databases (e.g., MySQL, Redis), messaging systems, or other APIs. Developers can cf create-service to bind a database to their app with a single command.
* **BOSH**: The underlying tool that provisions and manages the entire Cloud Foundry infrastructure (the VMs, networks, etc.). It's the tool for platform operators, not developers.

## Major Benefits
1. Developer Productivity: Drastically reduces the time from code to production. ```cf push``` is the core of this benefit.
2. Operational Efficiency: IT operations teams don't need to manually manage servers for each app. The platform automates provisioning, scaling, and healing.
3. Multi-Cloud Portability: Because it's open-source, Cloud Foundry can run on almost any cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud, OpenStack, etc.) or on-premises VMware infrastructure. This prevents vendor lock-in.
4. Application Automation: Automatically handles critical operations:
  * Scaling: Easily scale apps horizontally (```cf scale -i 5 MY-APP```) or vertically.
  * High Availability: The platform can restart crashed app instances automatically.
  * Logging: Streams application logs to the developer in real-time (~~cf logs MY-APP~~).
5. Polyglot Support: Supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks through buildpacks.
